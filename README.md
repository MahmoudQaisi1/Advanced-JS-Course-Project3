# Project: Movie Catalog CLI Application

## Description:

The Movie Catalog CLI Application is a Node.js-based command-line tool designed for managing a movie catalog. This project incorporates various programming concepts and features to provide users with a powerful and interactive movie management experience.

## Key Features:

- Display Movie Catalog:
The application reads movie data from a JSON file and presents users with a comprehensive list of movies in their catalog. Users can quickly review their collection.

- Add New Movie:
Users have the option to add new movies to their catalog by providing essential details such as title, director, release year, and genre. The application automatically stores this data in the JSON file, ensuring their catalog is up to date.

- Update Movie Details:
Movie enthusiasts can edit specific details of movies in their collection. By selecting a movie from the catalog, they can modify properties like title, director, release year, and genre.

- Delete Movie:
The application empowers users to remove any movie from their catalog effortlessly. A simple selection and deletion process help users keep their collection tidy and organized.

- Search and Filter:
Movie discovery becomes easier with the built-in search functionality. Users can look for movies based on title, director, or genre.
Additionally, users can filter their catalog using criteria like genre or release year to find movies that match their preferences.

- Fetch Movie Data:
To enrich their catalog, users can fetch additional movie information from external sources using the Fetch API. The application can communicate with movie databases like OMDB API, expanding their collection with up-to-date data.

- Modular Structure:
The project is structured with a modular design, dividing responsibilities into separate modules. This enhances code organization and makes it easier to maintain.
Modules for file handling, movie management, API requests, and user interaction ensure clean separation of concerns.

- Async Programming:
Asynchronous programming techniques, such as Promises or async/await, are employed to handle file
read/write operations and API requests efficiently. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience while preventing any blocking of the main program flow.

The Movie Catalog CLI Application offers movie enthusiasts a powerful yet user-friendly way to manage their movie collections. Whether it's adding new releases, updating movie details, or exploring new titles, this application simplifies the process while keeping movie data organized and up to date. Its modular structure and asynchronous programming techniques contribute to a seamless user experience.
